### Encoding/Decoding

A value of 99.9 would be submitted on-chain using the following bytes:

`0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000056a6418b505860000`

## Dispute Considerations

Reporters should seek guidance from the intended data consumer when selecting data sources and choosing the algorithm to combine them.

- Multiple sources should be used whenever possible.
- When retrieving data directly from and api (exchanges), feed users might expect that exchanges with lower volumes
have their prices weighted accordingly to avoid erratic results.
- Care should also be used when retrieving data from aggregators.
- It is the reporters responsibility to ensure that the feed result is *reasonable* enough for a community consensus, otherwise it may be subject to dispute.
- If a *reasonable* value cannot be determined, a value should not be submitted.
